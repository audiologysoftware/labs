                <h2>  Deglutition Lab</h2>

                <p>   The lab consists of a multidisciplinary team including speech-language pathologists, Ph.D. students, and post-doctoral fellows who are interested in exploring the mechanisms underlying swallowing impairment and finding ways to improve clinical practice and treatment outcomes. The lab aims to improve assessment, treatment, and quality of life for people with swallowing disorders. The research in the deglutition lab focuses primarily on understanding dysphagia and its impact on the patient. We aim to conduct research that will assist clinicians in providing the best possible evaluation and management to patients with dysphagia and help in reducing the burden of dysphagia for patients, their caregivers, and the community. The lab is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities to research on improving the quality of assessment and management of patients with swallow problems. Deglutition lab practices the traditional method and Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) method of treatment protocol in the rehabilitation of patients with dysphagia. </p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>

                <p>1. To produce quality clinicians who provide the best possible evaluation and management to patients with dysphagia and help in reducing the burden of dysphagia for patients, their caregivers, and the community.</p>
                <p>2. To publish research work related to swallowing physiology and dysphagia.</p>
                <p>3. To develop a self-reported assessment tool in vernacular language to identify the individual with dysphagia.</p>
                <p>4. To carry out research work that focuses on the effectiveness of dysphagia management in clinical conditions.</p>

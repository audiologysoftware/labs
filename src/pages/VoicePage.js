                <h2>  Voice Science Lab </h2>

                <p>  The Voice Science Lab in the institute is designed to conduct research activities for both the Master's and doctoral levels students and faculty in the areas of voice science and voice pathology to promote the research outcomes to be applied in clinical practice. The Voice Science lab is equipped with a soundproof room for recording the signal. It also consists of equipment and software capable of performing a variety of research tasks related to the area. The lab consists of instruments for acoustic analysis, airflow measures, aerodynamic analysis, electroglottographic analysis, cepstral analysis, and inverse filtering. A variety of programs used to produce real-time spectrograms, Fast Fourier analyses, Dr. Speech Vocal Assessment-Diagnostic and Therapy, and Vaghmi diagnostic and therapy modules are also available. The voice science lab focuses on research work related to assessment protocols and management strategies for individuals with voice disorders and among various professional voice users. </p>

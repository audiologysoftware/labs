        <h2>  Tinnitus Research Lab </h2>
        <p>  Our lab specializes in the evaluation and intervention of tinnitus, a prevalent auditory sensation characterized by ringing or buzzing perceived without external stimuli. We conduct thorough assessments using advanced diagnostic tools to understand tinnitus severity and associated factors. Employing a multidisciplinary approach, we develop innovative interventions tailored to individual needs, drawing from sound therapy, cognitive behavioral techniques, and neuromodulation. Collaborating across disciplines, we aim to advance understanding of tinnitus pathophysiology and refine treatment protocols. By translating research into practical solutions, we strive to empower individuals affected by tinnitus and improve global management efforts. Through our commitment to excellence in research, clinical care, and education, we seek to make a meaningful impact on tinnitus sufferers' quality of life.</p>

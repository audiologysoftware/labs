        <h2>About Electrophysiology Lab</h2>

        <p>Welcome to the Electrophysiology Lab at the Department of Audiology, JSS Institute of Speech and Hearing, Mysuru. The lab helps undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students to delve into the intricate world of auditory science. Our lab serves as a dynamic learning hub equipped with state-of-the-art technology for studying the electrical activity of the auditory system. Under the guidance of expert faculty, students explore techniques such as auditory brainstem response (ABR), otoacoustic emissions (OAE), and electrocochleography (ECochG) to understand the neural mechanisms underlying hearing. Through hands-on experience and research opportunities, students gain valuable insights into diagnosing and treating auditory disorders, preparing them for rewarding careers in audiology.</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>

        <p>1. Hands-on Training: Provide undergraduate and postgraduate students with practical experience in utilizing electrophysiological techniques to assess auditory function.</p>
        <p>2. Understanding Neural Mechanisms: Enable students to comprehend the neural processes involved in hearing by analyzing auditory brainstem responses, otoacoustic emissions, and electrocochleography.</p>
        <p>3. Diagnostic Proficiency: Equip students with the skills to effectively diagnose auditory disorders by interpreting electrophysiological data and correlating findings with clinical presentations.</p>
        <p>4. Research Exploration: Encourage students to engage in research projects exploring novel electrophysiology applications in audiology, fostering innovation and advancements in the field.</p>
        <p>5. Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Facilitate collaboration between audiology students and other healthcare professionals to broaden perspectives and enhance interdisciplinary approaches to hearing healthcare.</p>

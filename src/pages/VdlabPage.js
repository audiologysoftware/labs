        <h2>Psychoacoustics and Speech Perception Lab</h2>

        <p>This lab is installed to provide laboratory exercises to students of audiology to carry out different psychoacoustic and speech perception experiments. This will help the students in carrying out, evaluating, and summarising the outcomes of psychoacoustic and speech perception experiments. Additionally, the facility is set up to carry out advanced research in the area. The topics for research may include the ability of listeners with normal hearing to function in complicated listening situations, how hearing loss affects this capacity; and how listening equipment, including hearing aids, may improve or affect this ability, etc. The lab also has deputed internal and external advisors to give valuable feedback and suggestions about the research work proposed to be done in the lab. </p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>The objectives of the psychoacoustics lab are to develop skills in designing, carrying out, and evaluating experiments using objective and subjective tests and various adaptive and fixed test procedures. The lab also aims to develop an understanding of basic auditory function in students using the following experiments:</p>
        <p>1. Absolute and masked detection</p>
        <p>2. Differential sensitivity for amplitude, frequency, and duration</p>
        <p>3. Non-simultaneous masking and pulsation thresholds</p>
        <p>4. Loudness, Pitch, duration, and its interactions with each other</p>
        <p>5. Binaural hearing</p>
        <p>6. Speech perception in noise</p>
        <p>7. Speech synthesis and analysis</p>
        <p>8. Basic Auditory Physiology</p>

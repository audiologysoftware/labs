        <h2>  Amplification Research lab </h2>

        <p>   Our lab focuses on two primary areas of research: the features of hearing aids and speech perception, and the study of listening effort and fatigue. In the first area, we investigate the latest advancements in hearing aid technology and their impact on speech perception among individuals with hearing loss. Our research aims to enhance understanding of how specific features of hearing aids influence speech intelligibility and communication outcomes. In the second area, we explore the psychological and physiological factors contributing to listening effort and fatigue experienced by individuals with hearing impairment. Through interdisciplinary approaches, we strive to uncover strategies for reducing listening effort and mitigating the effects of auditory fatigue, ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals with hearing difficulties.</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>

        <p>1.	Investigating the efficacy of different hearing aid features on improving speech perception in individuals with hearing loss.</p>
        <p>2.	Exploring the impact of advanced hearing aid technologies on communication outcomes and quality of life.</p>
        <p>3.	Examining the relationship between hearing aid settings and speech intelligibility in various listening environments.</p>
        <p>4.	Identifying factors that contribute to listening effort and fatigue in individuals with hearing impairment.</p>
        <p>5.	Developing strategies and interventions to reduce listening effort and alleviate auditory fatigue.</p>
        <p>6.	Conducting research to enhance understanding of the psychological and physiological mechanisms underlying listening effort and fatigue.</p>

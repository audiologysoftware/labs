        <h2>Central Auditory Processing Lab (CAPL)</h2>

        <p>The Central Auditory Processing Lab at the JSS Institute of Speech and Hearing harnesses principles of neuroscience, speech perception, language, and cognition to understand how individuals with normal hearing decode information in everyday listening environment as well as in a competing environment. We also study how the various auditory processes mature over time and learn about changes in plasticity with age. The nature of work done in the lab is aimed at stipulating evidence-based practice in the assessment and management of individuals with central auditory processing disorders. We use subjective, behavioral as well electrophysiological tests to gain insights regarding the functioning of the central auditory nervous system. We train students to differentially diagnose various disorders. Our lab engages in inter-professional collaborative practices by partnering with experts to tailor make the rehabilitative programs. With this, we strive to alleviate the problems encountered by our patients and reduce the impact of the disorder.

        <h2>Objectives</h2>

        <p>1.	To develop, standardize, and validate test materials aimed at understanding various auditory processes (binaural integration, auditory closure, binaural interaction, and temporal processing) as well as higher-order auditory processing (auditory memory).</p>
        <p>2.	To determine the prevalence of auditory processing disorder among individuals across the lifespan.</p>
        <p>3. To investigate the developmental and age-related changes in auditory processing abilities across the lifespan.</p>
        <p>4. To assess the impact of certain health conditions on auditory processing and cognitive abilities.</p>
        <p>5. To determine the correlation between behavioural, electrophysiological findings, and clinical correlates to strengthen the diagnosis.</p>
        <p>6. To document the effects of intervention on various auditory processes as well as higher-order cognitive abilities.</p>
        <p>7. To engage in inter-professional collaborative practice to alleviate the problems faced by individuals with auditory processing disorders.</p>

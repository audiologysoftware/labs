                <h2>  Acoustic and Sociophonetic Lab </h2>

                <p>   The Acoustic and Sociaphonetics Lab is dedicated to the scientific examination of speech sound properties and their acoustic-spectral characteristics. The activities carried out here can help the students to understand speech production, transmission, and perception comprehensively in terms of the acoustic & spectral cues. This lab is also dedicated to sophisticated inquiries into the dynamic interplay between speech acoustics and social determinants. The activities carried out are aimed to encourage students in elucidating how factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, social class, and geographic locale influence speech patterns and acoustic properties. </p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>

                <p>1. To conduct fundamental research in speech acoustics and sociophonetics, aiming to deepen our understanding of the intricate relationship between sound properties, social factors, and language variation.</p>
                <p>2. To provide comprehensive training to individuals interested in pursuing clinical and research activities in speech acoustics and sociophonetics, thereby fostering the development of skilled professionals in these specialized fields.</p>
                <p>3. To develop standardized guidelines, procedures, and protocols for the measurement and analysis of speech acoustics and sociophonetic parameters, ensuring consistency and reliability in research methodologies and outcomes.</p>
                <p>4. To disseminate scientific knowledge and findings pertaining to speech acoustics and sociophonetics to the broader scientific community through scholarly publications, thereby contributing to the advancement of research and understanding in these domains.</p>

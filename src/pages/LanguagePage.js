                <h2> LANGUAGE AND NEUROCOGNITION LAB </h2>

                <p>  The Language and Neurocognition Lab is currently engaged in several diverse research works focused on studying the neural basis of language processing and cognitive functions related to language, across the lifespan. The lab brings in researchers from different fields such as speech-language pathology, audiology, neurology, and psychology, and facilitates investigations on how the brain processes language, how language skills develop, and how language is related to other cognitive functions. The members of the lab are involved in conducting experimental research and translational research. </p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
                <p>1. To explore how language skills develop in children with a specific interest in phonological development, and the emergence of syntax and semantics.</p>
                <p>2. To investigate neural mechanisms involved in language comprehension, production, and other cognitive functions related to language.</p>
                <p>3. To investigate the impact of aging on language and cognition.</p>
                <p>4. To examine the neural basis of language disorders, such as dyslexia, specific language impairment, or aphasia. The goal is to facilitate early identification, accurate diagnosis, and develop targeted interventions.</p>
                <p>5. To understand how the brain processes multiple languages in bilingual and multilingual individuals. To investigate the cognitive benefits and challenges associated with bilingualism, including the mechanisms involved in language switching.</p>
                <p>6. To investigate the neural underpinnings of various cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and executive functions.</p>
                <p>7. To work on the development and validation of indigenous test materials to assess language and cognitive functions.</p>
                <p>8. To foster collaboration among researchers from diverse fields, including linguistics, psychology, audiology, neurology, and computer science. This interdisciplinary approach will lead to comprehensive insights into the complex nature of language and cognition.</p>
                <p>9. To train and educate students and researchers interested in the intersection of language and neurocognitive sciences. This involves mentoring students, offering research opportunities, and contributing to academic programs.</p>
